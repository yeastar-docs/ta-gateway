    <title>Static Route</title>
    <shortdesc>TA FXS gateway will have more than one Internet connection in some situations but it
        has only one default gateway. You need to set some static route for TA FXS gateway to force
        it to go out through different gateway when accessing to different Internet.</shortdesc>
    <body>
        <p>The default gateway priority of TA FXS Gateway from high to low is VPN/VLAN â†’ LAN
            port.</p>

                            provide measurable statistic which can be used to judge how useful (how
                            low cost) a route is.</entry>
