                <li>If <uicontrol>Reset configuration to Factory Defaults</uicontrol> is enabled,

                <li>When updating the firmware, donâ€™t turn off the power. Or the system will be
                    damaged.</li>
                <li>If you are trying to upgrade through HTTP, make sure that your TA1600/2400/3200
                    is able to visit external network, or it cannot access Yeastar website to get
                    the firmware file, causing the upgrade fail.</li>
