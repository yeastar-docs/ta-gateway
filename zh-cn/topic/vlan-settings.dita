    <title>VLAN Settings</title>
    <shortdesc>VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a group of hosts with a common set of
        requirements, which communicate as if they were attached to the same broadcast domain,
        regardless of their physical location.</shortdesc>
    <body>
        <p>A VLAN is a broadcast domain created by switches. This means the VLAN is configured on
            switches, layer 3 switches.</p>
        <p>
            <note>
                <ul id="ul_cyf_lqt_zgb">
                    <li>Some of the switches donâ€™t support VLAN.</li>
                    <li>TA1600/2400/3200 acts as an VLAN client, a 3-layer switch is needed.</li>
